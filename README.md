# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## What is all of this nonsense

I mostly work on AWS and CI/CD stuff but I dabble in other things. 

I learn a lot by selfhosting and therefore will have a few projects related to that here as well.

I also like to hack on keyboards so enjoy some of my open-source hardware and the associated firmware that also lives in my repos.

I enjoy the types of tools that come with [dotfiles](https://github.com/vmorganp/dotfiles) like neovim, tmux, and i3wm. 

## Ok, but where's your professional work?
On my github you'll mostly see my "free time projects", not my professional contributions. I use other GitHub accounts when working professionally.

You can see my cool green squares over at @MorganPattersonSignet and @morganpa


Hit me up if you have a cool project and need help deploying or something like that.
