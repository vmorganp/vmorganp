### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I mostly work on DevOps stuff but I dabble in other things. 

On my github you'll mostly see my "free time projects", not my professional contributions. I use another GH account when working professionally.

I learn a lot by selfhosting and therefore will have a few projects related to that here as well.
I also like to hack on keyboards so enjoy some of my open-source hardware and the associated firmware that also lives in my repos.

Hit me up if you have a cool project and need help deploying or something like that.
